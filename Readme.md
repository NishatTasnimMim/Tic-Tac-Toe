Android Studio has been used as an IDE to build and run Java code for the 
two-player Android game. Tic-Tac-Toe can be played as an output on a virtual device that appears 
with the use of an Android emulator. There is a dashboard that displays the total victory records for 
players 1 and 2. And a reset button that restarts the currently playing game on the screen as well as 
resets the dashboard to zero.
